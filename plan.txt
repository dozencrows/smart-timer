Smart Kitchen Timer Plan
========================

To Do
-----
* Try 'unity' build to see any effect on size
* Investigate reducing power consumption further
  * Ensure clocks turned off to everything not needed
  * Only turn on interrupts
  * Try sleep/power down mode after idle timeout; wake-up on button press interrupt
* Fix 'first second' inaccuracy
* Try larger characters
* Eliminate divide calls
* Create release build (no printf)
* Try battery power supply options:
  * Other battery sizes
* Try level conversion breakout
* Try other piezo sounders to get better volume
* Custom PCB
* Case and button covers

WIP
---
* Try interrupt driven button polling: LPC side
  * Enable & disable other interrupts (timer, buzzer) as needed
  * Improve button responsiveness

Done
----
* Leave backlight on for 2 seconds on boot
* Switch MCP23017 with MCP23008
* Tested with 4 x AA and 5V regulator
* Try interrupt driven button polling: GPIO extender side
* Try interrupt driven button polling: LPC side
  * Rejig main loop to be WFI based
