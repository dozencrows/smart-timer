Smart Kitchen Timer Plan
========================

To Do
-----
Software:
* Investigate reducing power consumption further
  * Try sleep/power down mode after idle timeout; wake-up on button press interrupt
* Investigate intermittent I2C errors (may be hardware)
* Replace error strings with numeric codes (memory saving)
* Fix 'first second' inaccuracy
* Try larger characters
* Try custom characters

Hardware:
* Try battery power supply options:
  * Other battery sizes
* Try 2 channel level conversion breakout
* Try other piezo sounders to get better volume
* Try piezo sounder with built-in oscillator to simplify code & see if power reduces
* Custom PCB
* Case and button covers

Done
----
* Leave backlight on for 2 seconds on boot
* Switch MCP23017 with MCP23008
* Tested with 4 x AA and 5V regulator
* Try interrupt driven button polling: GPIO extender side
* Try interrupt driven button polling: LPC side
  * Rejig main loop to be WFI based
  * Enable & disable buzzer interrupt as needed
  * Improve button responsiveness
* Try 'unity' build to see any effect on size
  * Actually made it slightly bigger
* Removed printf to save memory
* Refactor main module button handling to better encapsulate GPIO expanded & interrupt handling
* Eliminate divide calls
