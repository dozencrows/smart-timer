Smart Kitchen Timer Plan
========================

To Do
-----
Software:
* Investigate intermittent I2C errors (may be hardware)
* Replace error strings with numeric codes (memory saving)
* Fix 'first second' inaccuracy
* Try larger characters
* Try custom characters

Hardware:
* Try push/pull piezo driver with 
* Try battery power supply options:
  * Other battery sizes
* Try 2 channel level conversion breakout
* Try other piezo sounders to get better volume
* Custom PCB
* Case and button covers

WIP
---
* Use pin 8 (PIO0_0) to drive switch controlling LCD on & off for power saving
  * Tried 2N7000 MOSFET as per http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/transistor/tran_7.html, but
    can't get enough current through (~91mA with 3.3V on gate, ~128mA with 5V on gate).
    * Looks like Vds vs Ids for given Vgs curves bear that out, certainly for Vgs 3.3V. But Vgs 5V should do it.
  * Try a 2N2222 instead - be careful about R on base to ensure current is OK!
    
Done
----
* Leave backlight on for 2 seconds on boot
* Switch MCP23017 with MCP23008
* Tested with 4 x AA and 5V regulator
* Try interrupt driven button polling: GPIO extender side
* Try interrupt driven button polling: LPC side
  * Rejig main loop to be WFI based
  * Enable & disable buzzer interrupt as needed
  * Improve button responsiveness
* Try 'unity' build to see any effect on size
  * Actually made it slightly bigger
* Removed printf to save memory
* Refactor main module button handling to better encapsulate GPIO expanded & interrupt handling
* Eliminate divide calls
* Try piezo sounder with built-in oscillator to simplify code & see if power reduces
  * Didn't observe power difference.
  * Was able to cut down buzzer interrupt rate
* Investigate reducing power consumption further
  * Initial interrupt driven approach means already using sleep mode
  * Deep sleep mode when timers idle -> 6x reduction in power for LPC 
* Fix initial beep at start with continuous tone buzzer
  * Add pull-down R to transistor base
* Add temp resistor to control continuous tone buzzer volume for dev purposes
