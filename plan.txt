Smart Kitchen Timer Plan
========================

To Do
-----
* Try 'unity' build to see any effect on size
* Try interrupt driven button polling
* Investigate reducing power consumption further
  * Ensure clocks turned off to everything not needed
  * Try sleep/power down mode after idle timeout; wake-up on button press interrupt
* Fix 'first second' inaccuracy
* Try larger characters
* Eliminate divide calls
* Create release build (no printf)
* Try battery power supply options:
  * 4 x AA
  * Add 5V regulator
  * Other battery sizes
* Switch MCP23017 with MCP23008
* Try level conversion breakout
* Try other piezo sounders to get better volume
* Custom PCB
* Case and button covers

Done
----
* Leave backlight on for 2 seconds on boot
